# Computational-Musicology

## Introduction:
 Outsider music is a derivative of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/outsider-art">outsider art</a>, which is defined as "any work of art produced by an untrained idiosyncratic artist who is typically unconnected to the conventional art world—not by choice but by circumstance." Its defining feature is "the tendency of the artists to be “straight talking” (even if that talk is straight from a radically different worldview)." 

In 2000, Irwin Chusid conceptualized the term outsider music in his book: Songs in the Key of Z, in which he explores the field of outsider music by highlighting its most prominent artists. Chusid defines outsider music as "crackpot and visionary music, where all trails lead essentially one place: over the edge." The book was accompanied by two compilation albums that featured a variety of outsider musicians. My corpus will consist of albums from artists that can be found on these compilation albums. The goal is to analyze the corpus with metrics provided by Spotify, and determine whether it is possible to categorize these outsider musicians on the basis of these metrics.

## Corpus:
 -  Life In the USA and Canada, by B.J. Snowden
 -  Eilart Is Back, by Eilert Pilram
 -  Greatest Hits, Wesley Willis
 -  God Bless Tiny Tim, by Tiny Tim
 -  Philosophy of the World, by The Shaggs
 -  Yip! Jump Music, by Daniel Johnston
 
 
## Discussion:
I decided to pick these albums mainly because they were created by outsider musicians that were classified as such by the person who introduced the concept of outsider music. However, I chose these particular artists from Chusid's book because I have listened to these albums and I actually find them very enjoyable.   

### Interesting songs
- In Canada, by B.J Snowden
- Suspicious Minds, by Eilert Pilram
- I Wupped Batman's Ass, by Wesley
- Livin' In the Sunlight, Lovin' In the Moon Light, by Tiny Tim
- Who Are Parents?, by The Shaggs 
- The Beatles, by Daniel Johnston
I've highlighted these songs for two reasons, (1) because they all possess a childlike quality, a feature that is often mentioned as a characteristic of outsider music; (2) and because I wanted to examine at least one song of every artist in the corpus in more detail. It will be interesting to see if the childlike quality would in some way be reflected in the metrics, valence could show to be fruitful, as optimism and positivity are common traits of childlike music. It might not be enough to confidently categorize outsider music, but it could be a starting point.
 
### Strengths and limitations of the corpus:
-The artists all have a very unique style of making music.

-All of Wesley Willis' songs have the exact same structure, perhaps this could be valuable, who knows. 

-Eilart Pilram is a Swedish Elvis impersonator, thus his album is entirely comprised of Elvis covers.

+All of the albums have been classified as outsider music, without much debate. Except for that one time that B.J. Snowden criticized Chusid because she felt she did not belong on his list of outsiders.

+Variety in styles might point to some interesting differences between these outsider musicians.

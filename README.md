# Computational-Musicology

## Introduction:
 Outsider music is a derrivative of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/outsider-art">outsider art</a>, which is defined as "any work of art produced by an untrained idiosyncratic artist who is typically unconnected to the conventional art world—not by choice but by circumstance." Its defining feature is "the tendency of the artists to be “straight talking” (even if that talk is straight from a radically different worldview)." 

In 2000, Irwin Chusid conseptualised the term outsider music in his book: Songs in the Key of Z, in which he explores the field of outsider music by highlighting its most prominent artists. Chusid defines outsider music as "crackpot and visionary music, where all trails lead essentially one place: over the edge." The book was accompanied by two compilation albums that featured a variety of outsider musicians. My corpus will consist of albums from artists that can be found on these compilation albums. The goal is to analyse the corpus with metrics provided by Spotify, and determine weather it is possible catogorize these outider musicians on the basis of these metrics.

## Corpus:
 -  Life In the USA and Canada, by B.J. Snowden
 -  Eilart Is Back, by Eilert Pilram
 -  Rock 'N' Roll Will Never Die, Wesley Willis
 -  God Bless Tiny Tim, by Tiny Tim
 -  Philosophy of the World, by The Shaggs
 -  Yip! Jump Music, by Daniel Johnston
 
 
## Discussion:
I decided to pick these albums mainly because they were created by outisder musisians that were classified as such by the person who introduced the concept of outsider music. However, I chose these particular artists from Chusid's book because I have listened to these albums and I actually find them very enjoyable.   

### Interesting songs
- In Canada, by B.J Snowden
- Suspicious Minds, by Eilert Pilram
- 
- Livin' In the Sunlight, Lovin' In the Moon Light, by Tiny Tim
- Who Are Parents?, by The Shaggs 
- The Beatles, by Daniel Johnston
I've highlighted these songs because they all poses a childlike quality, a feature that is often mentioned as a characteristic of outsider music. It will be interesting to see if this quality would in someway be reflected in the metrics. It might not be enough to confidently catogorize outsider music, but it could be a starting point.
 
### Strengths and limitations of the corpus:
 + + All of the albums have been classified as outsider music, without much debate. Except for that one time that B.J. Snowden criticised Chusid because she felt she did not belong on his list of outsiders.

Outsider music is a <a href="www.google.com">derrivative of outsider art</a>

In 2000, Irwin Chusid released his book: Songs in the Key of Z, a book that explores the field of outsider music by highlighting its most prominent artists. Chusid defines outsider music as "crackpot and visionary music, where all trails lead essentially one place: over the edge." The book was accompanied by two compilation albums that featured a variety of outsider musicians. My corpus will consist of albums from artists that can be found on these compilation albums.

Corpus:
 -  Life In the USA and Canada, by B.J. Snowden
 -  Eilart Is Back, by Eilert Pilram
 -  Rock 'N' Roll Will Never Die, Wesley Willis
 -  God Bless Tiny Tim, by Tiny Tim
 -  Philosophy of the World, by The Shaggs
 -  Hi, How Are You, by Daniel Johnston
